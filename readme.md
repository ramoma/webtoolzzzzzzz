BIG WARNING!!!! I DID THIS BECAUSE I DECIDED TO JUST INSTALL SASS/BOOTSTRAP ONTO MY COMPUTER
AND I SUGGEST YOU DO SO ASWELL (not forcing u to do so tho since i am configuring the stuff
on my end too so technically you dont have to do anything :3) READ THE COMMENTS IN THE "sass/
main.scss" FILE BECAUSE THOSE ARE GONNA BE REALLY HELPFUL

thats all thank you :3
